I did not discuss this assignment with anyone besides the Teaching Staff (Xiao).

The most difficult part of this assignment was starting off. I was confused with the instructions and
if I was supposed to implement the sharding functionality for part A. Once I had figured that out, I began
implementing stripe classes with methods like Get, Set, and Delete to make it easier to implement the cache.
Once the stripe data store was defined, it became easier to read the spec and implement the cache methods.
When I began testing part A, I first failed many of the tests for incorrect error messages. It wasn't very clear
that I needed to create an error with a codes.InvalidArgument. Once I figured that out, I was able to pass all the tests.
We then began to implement part D. We had a bug where we were not properly converting the TTL on the client side.
Once this issue was resolved, we were able to get 100% accuracy on the stress test and finish the assignment.
