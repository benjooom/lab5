Besides Alice and Gabe, my group members, I did not speak to anyone for more than 10 minutes.

The most difficult part of this assignment was understanding the Raft algorithm.
It has so many little details, that when misssed, will throw off your solution. Despite
putting in a lot of time before to understand Raft, when I went to code it, I still misssed
little nuanced details that are very much present in the paper, but not explicitly spelled out.
Hence, debugging consumed most of my time. Part C was quite easy when it came to persistance,
but it uncovered other errors in my code that I spent a lot of time trying to debug and fixed.
At one point, my code became very clunky so I spent a few hours refactoring it to make it a
bit cleaner and more efficient. Until I did the lab, I didn't realize how big of a factor choosing
good election timeouts and heartbeat timeouts are. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the
best combination to get an efficient, but robust solution.
