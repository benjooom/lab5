Besides Alice and Gabe, my group members, and coursestaff I did not speak to anyone for more than 10 minutes.

The most difficult part of the assignment was the learning curve. I was tasked with working on part C in my group
and efficiently handling shard map updates (copying shard contents as well). I had to first understand part A, which Gabe
completed, so that I could make adjustments to his implementations that would be compatible with part C. Debugging part C
was a bit tricky because there were multiple locks involved in my implementation. I had to fix a few race conditions. Once
we passed all of the tests, as a group we stress tested and found a bug with TTLs. It ultimately ended up being a time unit
conversion issue where we were using both microseconds and milliseconds. However, this stumped us for quite a while because
all the debugging showed that our server implementation was solid.
