Besides Alice and Gabe, my group members, I did not speak to anyone for more than 10 minutes.

The most difficult part of the assignment was figuring out streaming and how to test our implementation of streaming.
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to mock streaming so that it works with the unittests. Unfortunately,
after spending hours and failing, we decided our efforts would be better spent elsewhere. Hence, I tested the shard migration and
streaming by running the system on my machine and manually calling get, set, getList, getSet, setList, and setSet. Additionally,
we spent a lot of time trying to deploy our system on the Zoo. However, due to encoding issues, we were unable to get it to work.
Given that the Zoo is a restrectited setting that doesn't allow students to install their own software, we decided that it was not
worth the time. Instead we deployed our system between two of our own computers successfully. I also spent some time adding get/set
entire set/list RPCs to the system. This was not too difficult. Finally, we spent a lot of time working on the final report, making
sure it was clear, concise, and informative.
