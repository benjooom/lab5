Outside of my group and Ross's office hours, I did not consult any outside sources.

Definitely the most difficult part of this assignment was debugging. I was lucky enough that the client part of the problem set was relatively lighter, and the spec was straightforward. However, I made a very small error with converting the TTL, which led to 2% failure in the stress tester. This taught me the importance of writing strong unit test cases to debug, which could have potentially caught our expiration error. Similarly, I learned how to log output in the debugging process, but I definitely learned how it could be difficult to debug distributed systems where both the client and server are fallible.
